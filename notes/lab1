So far I have:

added threadtest4 to the menu
made a file named threadfun with just a hello world in it
added threadfun to the config file
added stephen.h as a place to put interfaces 

thread_fork sends the entrypoint to switchframe_init. 
switchframe is another word for Process Control Block

types.h before lib.h!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

to compile the os, go to depend/name of assignment and:
pmake depend
pmake
pmake install
